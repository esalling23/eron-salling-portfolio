During my time on this project I've implemented various features including:
- A robust campaign system that allows players to complete tasks within the game in order to receive rewards
- A dialogue system to support interactive NPCs for campaigns and other activities
- Player level rewards track so that each level has something exciting for players to use as they advance within the game world",https://www.minesofdalarnia.com/,"2,5",0
16,sapcevalues.gif,Icon_9.png,Space Values,2022-12-10,2023-03-10,"Space Values was a unique game that involved students combining blobs with number representations in order to determine a total from an addition problem.

This game had some new challenges such as draggable elements with animation based on distance to other elements on the screen. Animation needed to play based on that distance, so again performance was a big concern. The game was tested extensively on mobile to ensure the animations would be fluid and have the same experience as on desktop.",,"1,2,3,4",0
15,purrfect_short.gif,Icon_6.png,The Purrfect Plot,2022-04-10,2022-08-10,"The Purrfect Plot follows a cast of mischievious cats in their mission to take over the world via the internet. Students are provided with a grid of packages, each labeled with a number representation. The goal is to find matches of three, and players are shown an interactive number line to explore if their matches were in fact the same value. 

The animation work in this game was more involved on the development side than the art side, with a lot of work using GSAP/Greensock. The two parts of the game both had their unique animation challenges. The grid needed to include just the right amount of box bounciness and correctly manage layering images on top of each other during and after boxes fell out of view. The interactive timeline was more complex in that it was interactive - we needed to manage a large number of animating elements on the screen at once, and minimize impact on performance while still providing a convincing animation for the expected age group which was 4-5th grade.",,"1,2,3,4",0
14,patchitup.gif,Icon_8.png,Patch It Up,2022-08-10,2022-11-20,"Patch It Up is a sewing game designed to teach introductory algebra and PEMDAS concepts. Students fill in blanks in an equation involving both addition and multiplication, and see the statement represented with different sized patches for a quilt. 

This game involved a lot of complex front end layout work to ensure all content fit on the screen. Different problems had different formats, and each needed to fit its shapes and equation in the same way. Given that players could enter large ranges of numbers for their answers, it was also important to design the layout so that incorrectly sized boxes could overflow and be ""clearly unreadable"" if the user was entering wildly incorrect answers. The box components were designed to be extremely flexible and included perimeter notation that would center and resize itself based on box height or width.",,"1,2,3,4",0
13,partytimes.gif,Icon_5.png,Party Times,2022-07-10,2022-10-20,"Party Times is a game about parties! And counting, of course. Players help little partiers descipher orders in their party factory, grouping items in different amounts to begin breaking down the process of multiplication. The game was designed for third and fourth graders, and features a fun animation of items filling the room if players enter numbers that are much too large.",,"1,2,3,4",0
12,ants.gif,antsicon.png,Ants on Parade,2021-12-10,2022-02-20,"Ants on Parade teaches second graders how to use a conventional ruler for measuring distances. Students play as a helper for some ants who are trying to reach a piece of food. Using a draggable ruler, players measure the screen and report the appropriate distance. If correct, food pieces of a given unit size would fall and be skewered into place, creating a bridge. Students would see that bridge break and fall down if incorrect, and the ant would walk across and collect the food if all went well. 

This game involved a lot of animation work, and I was lucky to be able to collaborate directly with the artist in order to work out how exactly the animation would work. Because the food pieces changed with each level, we designed the animations to have swappable assets. On the development side, the animation data would be modified at runtime, swapping out the default food image with a randomly chosen replacement.",,"1,2,3,4",0
10,PP.gif,pp_icon.jpg,Pigeon Post,2021-11-20,2022-03-10,"Pigeon Post is a math game that teaches reading early versions of number lines. Players attempt to guide a pigeon with a package to the correct drop-off location on the line, based on the number of notches and a few revealed numbers on the line. Upon an unsuccessful drop the package bounces back up after falling off-screen, and the pigeon returns to the start. If the drop is correct, the package lands in the hands of a satisfied customer.",,"1,2,3,4",0

This Alternate Reality Game (ARG) was built within Slack to encourage and measure teamwork while playing through an ""escape the room"" style mystery. Users used buttons and messages to interact with the bot and explore the game's rooms, discovering secrets and solving puzzles, including hatching a Tamogotchi-style creature. 

In addition to the game logic itself, this project required heavy data acquisition, as nearly every message sent within the game time was tracked for analysis by a team of researchers.",,"2,3,6",0

Teaming up with one of India’s most loved children’s cartoon characters, the game uses fun characters to expose some of the common hygiene mistakes and how to fix them. Gameplay includes chasing the “Germ Wizard” through an obstacle maze of grime and insects and using soap to fight off the germs.

The idea was pretty simple - Tinder for recycling. Swipe right to recycle, left to trash, and “super-like” to compost. Get a score based on what you get right, and learn along the way! The game was based on local campus data of what is often recycled incorrectly, in an attempt to inform the student body into being better recyclers. 

The game was built using Handlebars and Express, with a content management backend. Incoming students would play the game as part of school orientation to learn what could be recycled on campus.",https://recyclr-og.herokuapp.com/,"2,3,4,6",0
